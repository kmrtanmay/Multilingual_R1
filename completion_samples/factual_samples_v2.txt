<think> Artemisia annua, also known as sweet wormwood, is a traditional Chinese herb that has been used for centuries. It's closely related to the discovery of artemisinin, a compound that is highly effective in treating malaria, an infectious disease caused by certain parasites.

The antimalarial properties of Artemisia annua were not immediately recognized globally. In the early 1970s, China began searching for new treatments for malaria. In one of these attempts, scientists at the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine isolated a compound from Artemisia annua that exhibited significant antimalarial activity. It was eventually found that this compound was artemisinin.

Later in 1978, researchers at the University of Michigan isolated and named the artemisinin compound from Artemisia annua. They also discovered the antimalarial properties of this compound. Their work was based on early research done in China. However, the naming of the compound as "artemisinin" was actually recognized much later by the academic community, after a series of international collaborations confirmed its antimalarial effects.</think>

<think> Sanuki Udon is a type of noodle dish. To identify the prefecture, I need to recall the relation between the dish name and the region. In Japanese culture, the name "Udon" is often associated with specific regions. Sanuki Udon is a famous udon dish that originates from Kagawa Prefecture, located on the island of Shikoku. The naming convention often follows the pattern 'prefecture name' + 'Udon'. Kagawa is abbreviated as 'San' in reference to Sanuki, so Kagawa Prefecture is also referred to as 'Sanuki' in certain contexts. This is a common naming convention in Japan for dishes that originate from specific regions. Therefore, Sanuki Udon is associated with Kagawa Prefecture or Sanuki Prefecture.
