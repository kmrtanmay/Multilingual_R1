Completion: <think> The question is asking about the discovery of the anti-malaria properties of Artemisia annua, which is a plant used in traditional Thai medicine. To answer this, we need information about who discovered these properties. Artemisia annua, also known as sweet wormwood, has been used in traditional Chinese, Arab, and African medicine to treat fevers and malaria for centuries. The term "Artemisia annua" has a connection to Artemisia, the name of a Greek goddess of the harvest and medicine, but the question is specifically about the anti-malaria properties. These properties were first discovered by British biochemist William Campbell in 1970, particularly noting them in a strain of sweet wormwood collected from an indigenous Thai village. He realized that this strain contained an anti-malarial effect, which was very significant as it could be used to find a cure for malaria. However, the plant was not named after the Greek goddess, but the Swiss botanist Leonhart Fuchs, who first described the plant species. </think>

Completion: <think> Udon is traditionally made with wheat flour, making it a north Japanese dish. Sanuki Udon is a type of udon noodle known to be originated from Sanuki Province, which is now Kagawa Prefecture. Among the major regions known for udon, it's often associated with Osaka, Kansai, and some other cities rather than the more northern areas. The name 'Sanuki Udon' suggests it is specific to Sanuki region. Nonetheless, considering the traditional and popular forms of udon, I need to weigh the evidence.</think>

Based on the reasoning that Sanuki Udon is known to come from Sanuki Province, which is now part of Kagawa Prefecture, but the general form of udon is usually associated with other regions, I still lean towards Osaka or Kansai where udon is commonly known due to its popularity there. However, the question is asking specifically about Sanuki Udon in a general sense, and the origin does matter.

The language to use in the final answer is not specified, so I'll provide the answer in English, which is more universally understood and specific to Japanese cuisine vocabulary.

<answer> Sanuki Udon is not a popular form of udon noodles in the general sense. It is specifically associated with the Sanuki Region, which is now part of Kagawa Prefecture, Japan. Common forms of udon are more associated with the Kansai region, such as Kansai Udon or Osaka Udon. However, the direct answer to your question of the region where Sanuki Udon is commonly known would be Kagawa Prefecture in Japan.</answer>
