Completion: <think> Sanuki Udon is a type of noodle dish. To identify the prefecture, I need to recall the relation between the dish name and the region.

The naming convention often follows the pattern 'prefecture name' + 'Udon'. Kagawa is abbreviated as 'San' in reference to Sanuki, so Kagawa Prefecture is also referred to as 'Sanuki' in certain contexts.
